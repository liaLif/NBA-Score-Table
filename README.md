# NBA Score Table

In this exercise, I have created an NBA score table dynamically- not hard coded in my HTML file, by creating dynamic

elements and appending them to the page using the DOM. By using functions, I have made the code reusable and it can

take in any data. In this case, Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets.
